In the folder Magic Calculator you will find the directory of my project.

The folder will have another folder inside of it which is named 
'Application Shortcut', inside I have placed a shortcut of the executable 
which will save you some time of looking around to fint the file.

This project has been turned into an executable file using pyinstaller 
which may trigger some warnings for some antiviruses, however if you 
do get a warning go into your antivirus and select the app to be a 
false-positive. Some newer/better antiviruses will scan the app and see 
that there are in fact no problems with the application. I ensure you 
that this application is completely safe.

If you are having any problems with the application or have any feedback 
you would like to tell me about, feel free to contact me at:
